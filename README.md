The code will not run unless you open the code in Visual Studio and follow this ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRGPNi9mEMo&list=PL6xSOsbVA1eb_QqMTTcql_3PdOiE928up&index=2](https://youtu.be/KRGPNi9mEMo?t=281)) tutorial from 04:41. Alternatively, you can download the executable at https://github.com/sebastianhndelorenzo/Maxwell-Boltzmann-Executable.

The file "Particle Simulator" contains all of the programs I have written, namely "Box.h", "Box.cpp", "Button.h", "Button.cpp", "Game.h", "Game.cpp", "Graph.h", "Graph.cpp", "Particle.h", "Particle.cpp", and "main.cpp". All other files are from the SFML library.
